I know

I know I've let you down

I've been a fool to myself

I thought that I could live for no one else

But now

Through all the hurt and pain

It's time for me to respect

The ones you love mean more than anything

So with sadness in my heart

Feel the best thing I could do

Is end it all and leave forever

What's done is done it feel so bad

What once happy now is sad

I'll never love again 

My world is ending

I wish that I could turn back time 

Because now the guilt is all mine

can't live without the trust from those you love

I know we can't forget the past

You can't forget love and pride

Because of that 

it's killing me inside

it all returns to nothing

it all comes

tumbling down,tumbling down,tumbling down

it all returns to nothing

i just keep

letting me down,letting me down,letting me down

In my heart of hearts

I know that I could never love again

I've lost everything

Everything

everything that matters to me matters in the world
