And I love you so

The people ask me how

How I live till now

I tell them I don't know

I guess they understand

How lonely life has been

But life began again

The day you took my hand

And yes I know how lonely life can be

The shadows follow me

And the night won't set me free

But I don't let the evening get me down

Now that you're around me

And you love me too

Your thoughts are just for me

You set my spirit free

I'm happy that you do

The book of life is brief

And once a page is read

All but love is dead

That is my belief

And yes I know how lonely life can be

The shadows follow me

And the night won't set me free

But I don't let the evening get me down

Now that you're around me
